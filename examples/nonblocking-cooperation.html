    //   Now that this script block is finished, the first spawn callback can begin.
    //   It will add text 2 then stop on its 2500ms sleep yield, giving a chance for the
    //   second spawn callback to begin. The second spawn callback begins, adding text 3, and it then
    //   stops on its 500ms sleep yield. Since the other spawn callback is still busy with the 2500ms sleep,
    //   (and since there is no other code such as in any other spawns waiting to
    //   execute), the script will do nothing until the 500ms are up and then text 4 will be added.
    //   Since the 2500ms is still going on at this point and there is no other code waiting, the
    //   script will do nothing until the 2500ms are finished at which point execution can continue to let
    //   text 5 finally be added.
